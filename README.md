# COVID_19_Data_Storytelling
Finding answers within raw datasets to avoid media bias
The project uses R and Power BI in attempt to answer questions that were highly publicized in the media during the early days of COVID-19, then were all but never heard from again.  Questions will be answered such as "Does COVID-19 survive the winter?", "Does latitude affect prevalence rates?", and "Do people really think that New York could produce enough specially trained staff to care for an additional 40,000 ICU patients on ventilators?"  Multiple datasets contained within the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering's Github site were used.  (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData).
The majority of time spent on this project was in wrangling the data in preparation for correlations.
